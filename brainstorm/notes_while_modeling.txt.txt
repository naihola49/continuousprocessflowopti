learnings:

setpoints are determined control points for monitoring flow. the goal is to minimize the squared difference between
    actual and setpoint values. 

sensor reset occurs: NEED TO ENGINEER THIS FEATURE!
    most likely will create an indicator feature (binary)
    another approach: impute with median/average value because in theory data should be continuous at that val

different scales for measurement in stage 1
    will need to min-max or standardize for better predictions most likely
    because these are measurements at different points post-combiner, these measurements most likely have high
    correlation
        potential things to explore: 
            principal component analysis
            multivariate regression
            train-local statistics as features (to capture flow uniformity)
